Hi,
This is a program created 50% by a human and 50% by an AI.
It's a very nice cyberclock to put on any desktop, written entirely in HTML and supporting all browsers. 
The app itself is a simple clock that simulates a "MATRIX"-style drop-down terminal in the background, and it's very elegant. 
I'm leaving the source code for the open-source project in case anyone sees any problems and wants to modify something.
Thanks everyone for your interest!
